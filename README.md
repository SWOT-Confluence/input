# input

**NOTE: Input currently extracts and writes Sacramento data stored in a S3 bucket. It generates request fees.**

Input serves as the first Confluence module and takes SWOT shapefile data from a PO.DAAC S3 bucket and produces time series data saved as NetCDF files. The input module runs on the reach-level meaning it is parallelizable by SWORD reach identifier.
